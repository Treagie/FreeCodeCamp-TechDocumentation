            <h2>Preparations</h2>
            <p>When cooking a roast dinner, it is vital that you are prepared. The last thing you want is to get caught without your cranberry sauce or your beef dripping!</p>

            <h2>Meat</h2>
            <o>My favourite type of meat is <strong>beef</strong> so I'm going to talk about that. In particular, my favourite cut is prime rib and so I'll detail how to prepare and cook that to perfection.</o><br><br>
            <img alt="Prime Rib Beef" src="https://www.vickibensinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roast-Prime-Rib-of-Beef-580x435.jpg">
            <br>
            <p>Prime rib is expensive so you want to make the best of it and take your time. In short, it is a beautiful piece of beef so if you are someone who likes to absolutely crucify your beef then this isn't the cut for you. This is best served medium/rare and these instructions will help you achieve that.</p>
            <p>Firstly, take it out of the fridge the night before you want to cook it. Coat it in salt and pepper and leave it, loosely covered, on the side overnight. The salt will help to break down the meat and make it juicier, as well as helping to flavour it! Don't be afraid of using salt and, if you have it, I'd recommend using sea salt.</p>
            <p>When you're ready to actually cook it, you'll need to pre-heat the oven for 30-45 minutes at 180 degrees celsius. Place the oven on a griddle in a roasting tray. You could place onions in there as well but I will say this: if done right, this beef is tasty enough on its own!</p>
            <p>Cook the beef, uncovered, for 1 hour 15 minutes (for a one rib joint). If you feel it needs longer then do so in 15 minute increments, at the same temperature. This will depend on your taste.</p>
            <p>When done, remove it from its tray (don't do anything with the tray just yet!) and put it on a chopping board covered in foil. Let is rest for 20 minutes.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="potatoes">
            <h2>Potatoes</h2>
            <p>Roast potatoes should be golden and crispy on the outside whilst fluffy and light on the inside. They're also, basically, the best thing known to mankind when they're done right!</p><br>
            <img alt="Roast Potatoes" src="https://flockler.com/thumbs/sites/192/marcuspots_s600x600_c654x381_l0x224.png"><br>
            <p>I recommend using Rooster red potatoes because they're awesome and, in my opinion, really overlooked. However, they make great chips and roasties and all sorts. Peel them properly - nothing ruins roast potatoes like leaving bits of the skin on - and soak them in water for a few minutes to remove some of the starch. They should be cut into large chunks - I usually just halve a medium-sized potato. If you make them too small, they will need less cooking time. Replace the water, add a good amount of salt, and place them on to boil.</p>
            <p>Whilst the potatoes are boiling, add a few tablespoons of beef dripping to a roasting tray and put it in the oven to heat up.</p>
            <p>Bring them to the boil and turn them down to a simmer for 5-10 minutes. Before taking them off the heat, gently poke one with a fork - if it's soft then they're done. Using the lid to help strain, pour off the water and, holding the lid in place with one hand, use the saucepan to bash the potatoes up and down a few times until their edges are slightly broken up. Don't break them up too much - you just want them to be a bit fluffy.</p>
            <p>Add the potatoes to the hot beef dripping (which should now be clear liquid in the tray). Be careful because they will sizzle and maybe spit. Quickly use a spoon (or a baster, if you have one) to coat the potatoes in the hot fat. Put back in the oven and roast them for 40-50 minutes until golden and delicious!</p>

            <h2>Vegetables</h2>
            <h3>Parsnips</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and chop the parsnips into 'chips.'</li>
                <li>Boil the parsnips and bring them to the boil. Simmer them for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add them to the roast potato hot fat and cook for 30/35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Top tip: add some honey to them in the roasting tray.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Carrots & Swede</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and chop into small, equally-sized chunks.</li>
                <li>Boil/simmer them for a long time until they are soft - usually 20-30 mins.</li>
                <li>Mash them together - add some butter and pepper for flavour.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Brussel Sprouts</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the sprouts by trimming them and giving them a rinse.</li>
                <li>Boil them to soften them.</li>
                <li>When they are essentially cooked, stir fry them in a wok. If you have some bacon, trim it into little bits and stir fry it with them - it's a perkier way of serving them!</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>The Trimmings</h2>
                <h3 id="ypuds">Yorkshire Puddings</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Crack 2-3 eggs into a jug, removing any shell. Add the plain flour and milk and whisk thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>The mixture should be loose but with a thick consistency - if it's as thin as water then it's far too thin and add more flour.</li>
                    <li>Add salt and pepper to flavour and continue whisking.</li>
                    <li>Put the mixture in the fridge until time to begin cooking it. This will chill the mixture to ensure that it reacts as much as possible to the hot fat. Regularly whisk the mixture to create more air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Add a small amount of oil/beef dripping into each section of a yorkshire pudding/muffin tin. Put in the oven and allow it to get really hot.</li>
                    <li>Add the batter to the fat and quickly return to the oven. Cook for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Tips:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once the puds are in the oven, do not open the door until absolutel necessary.</li>
                            <li>The more you whisk, the better your puds will be.</li>
                            <li>Keep it simple - don't add beer or sparkling water, whisk to create more bubbles naturally.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="stuffing">Stuffing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>I would recommend sticking to a simple stuffing such as Paxo's Sage & Onion.</li>
                    <li>Add chopped up bacon and onion to lift it.</li>
                    <li>Follow the instructions on the box! Easy!</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="gravy">Gravy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the tray the beef cooked in to make the gravy.</li>
                    <li>Add beef stock, plain flour and boiling water to the juices in the tray.</li>
                    <li>Using a whisk, continuously move and combine the mixture in the tray over a a high heat. Once at the boil, turn it down to a simmer and keep it moving to avoid a skin forming.</li>
                    <li>If the flour clumps too much, keep whisking but the end result may need sieving to remove any unwanted lumps.</li>
                </ol>
